        "When writing C++ code for IMP it can sometimes be difficult to track down bugs in the code. Some more subtle bugs may not crash the program but give incorrect results; in other cases the results may look OK on some machines but not on others. Bugs with memory allocation may waste or even exhaust memory. In this tutorial we will cover using the [Valgrind](https://www.valgrind.org/) tool to assist in finding such issues. Valgrind runs your program in a virtual machine, so it can accurately track and verify all memory access (at the expense of running more slowly).\n",
